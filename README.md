- An additional logic was created to consume the service every 10 minutes, it is not any type of interval, it is a validation that saves the timestamp of the - last response from the server and validates if 10 minutes have already again to return the call to the server , otherwise, it use the response already saved. - - This only runs when there is some action  on click button.
